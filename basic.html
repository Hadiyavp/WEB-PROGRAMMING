<p><i>KMCT School of Business (KSB), established in 2004, functions as an autonomous department for Management Studies and Computer Applications under KMCT College of Engineering. The college is affiliated to APJ Abdul Kalam University (KTU) and approved by AICTE, New Delhi.</p></i>
<h2><center><u>MCA</u></center></h2>
<p><i>The Master of Computer Applications (MCA) Programme of KSB started in the year 2007. Apart from regular academics, we try to mould the students to get placed in reputed companies by expertising the students in real time software product development, offering the sessions to improve inter personal skills and communication abilities. MCA programme of KSB maintains a good track record of university results.</p></i>

<li><b><font color="CFIE56">DATA SRTUCTURE</b><p>A data structure is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several basic and advanced types of data structures, all designed to arrange data to suit a specific purpose. Data structures make it easy for users to access and work with the data they need in appropriate ways.</li></b></p>
<li><b><font color="9916B4">C PROGRAMMING</b><p>C (pronounced /ˈsiː/ – like the letter c) is a general-purpose computer programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie, and remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of the targeted CPUs.</li></p>
<li><b><font color="CFIE56">PYTHON</b><p>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language. Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages. Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</p</li>
<li><b><font color="9916B4">SOFTWARE ENGINEERING</b><p>Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for end users.</li></p>
